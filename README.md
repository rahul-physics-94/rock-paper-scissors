It is a basic rock paper scissors game.
The dependencies are:
**import random** //this will help us choose random options from the list provided and would give a different choice each time the code is run. This will passed on as the computer choices and
and input function is used to get the input from the user and as long as the user chooeses to play the game, the game will continue.
The while loop is a simple while loop which measures all the possible combinations of the game and displays a result based on that. If the choices are same between the user and the computer then the 1st case takes care of it.
The rest simply follow the logic of the same. There will be 2 test cases for reach options making the overall count of the test cases to 7.
